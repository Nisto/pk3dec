### Support ❤️

As of June 2024, my monthly salary has been cut by 50%. This has had a significant impact on my freedom and ability to spend as much time working on my projects, especially due to electricity bills. I don't like asking for favors or owing people anything, but if you do appreciate this work and happen to have some funds to spare, I would greatly appreciate any and all donations. All of your contributions goes towards essential everyday expenses. Every little bit helps! Thank you ❤️
